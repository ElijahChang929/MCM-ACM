# The Mathematical Contest in Modeling / The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling 

## I participated in the MCM/ICM competitions for two years. 

## In 2023, I tackled the "wordle" problem using a variety of methods including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), Grey Prediction, solutions to Partial Differential Equations, and Survival Analysis techniques. 

## In 2024, I addressed momentum issues in tennis matches using Hidden Markov Models, Trustworthy Machine Learning methods, and solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations.
